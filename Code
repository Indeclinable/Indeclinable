comment: Many people recommend pairing LLPSI with Wheelock, or using Wheelock as a consult grammar to learn what allegedly LLPSI does not explain or clarify sufficiently. This is inefficient/false for many reasons

1. LLPSI already includes a reference grammar called [Latīne discō](https://hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/lingua-latina-pars-i-latine-disco-student-s-manual-in-english) and even an expanded version of it: the [Companion](https://hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series/lingua-latina-a-companion-to-familia-romana-second-edition). Each one of those is a reference grammar tailored chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph to match LLPSI. (There are even Spanish, [Italian](https://vivariumnovum.it/scolastica/latino/corso-base/latine-disco), [French](https://archive.org/details/latinediscofr/) and [German](https://books.google.com/books?id=SHIZMgAACAAJ) versions of it). 

2. Even in the highly unlikely case that the explanations in either the Latīne discō or the Companion turned to be insufficient. Please ask for specific instances/examples of this. There are copyright-free options of [Latin grammars](www.edonnelly.com/google.html#2) and [beginner books](www.edonnelly.com/google.html#1) that serve the exact same purpose as Wheelocks, frankly much better and user-friendly like [Nutting](https://archive.org/details/latinprimer00nuttuoft/page/n5/mode/2up), [Gildersleeve](https://archive.org/details/latinprimerintro00gildrich/page/n3/mode/2up) or [Kennedy](https://archive.org/details/revisedlatinprim00kenniala/page/n3/mode/2up). [Collar & Daniell](https://archive.org/details/firstyearlatin00collrich/page/n7/mode/2up) offers excellent reading material for beginners as does Nutting, plus he has an extra [Reading book](https://archive.org/details/afirstlatinread02nuttgoog/page/n4/mode/2up). All of them are free.

3. In case you really wanted a more modern printed reference book [Moreland & Fleischer](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520031838/) is a [far better alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/huh8qg/this_subs_opinion_on_moreland_and_fleischer/), even if you went for a full grammar-translation approach.

Other discussions regarding this topic can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gxpyr5/comment/ft4e16h/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/gh5nr1/sources_recommended_for_learning_latin/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/8rp222/is_the_wheelock_latin_textbook_good_for_beginners/). 

TL:DR, we still don't understand why people keep recommending Wheelock at all, even in scenarios where LLPSI is not included, but debate is always welcome.
